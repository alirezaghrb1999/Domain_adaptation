# Domain_adaptation
Domain adaptation is a crucial aspect of machine learning and artificial intelligence that addresses the challenge of adapting a model trained on one domain to another domain with varying data distribution. The primary objective of domain adaptation is to enhance the performance of a model on a target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. This approach is particularly useful when there is limited labeled data available for the target domain but abundant labeled data available for the source domain. Domain adaptation can be applied in diverse areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics.

One of the most effective techniques for solving domain adaptation problems is discriminative adversarial neural networks (DANN). By using DANN, I have successfully addressed a common issue in computer vision, where the feature distribution in the training dataset differs significantly from that in the test dataset. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, I have implemented it on two datasets: Office datasets and Vehicle classification dataset.

Initially, I trained Resnet50 without domain adaptation and then used DANN to showcase the improvement in model accuracy. The results showed that DANN significantly improved the model's performance on the target domain by effectively leveraging knowledge from the source domain.
